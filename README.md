## Description

This repo contains basic text processing code in Python we used as part of our EEG/ERP study of working memory and attention during simultaneous interpreting. For more, refer to our other repositories [here](https://github.com/RomanKoshkin/EEG), [here](https://github.com/RomanKoshkin/R) and [here](https://github.com/RomanKoshkin/VBA).

This repo contains the macros we used to prepare time-coded transcripts of source audio and their translated versions for further use in conjunction with EEG data and analysis in MATLAB and R. For other scripts and datasets, refer to our other repositories [here](https://github.com/RomanKoshkin/EEG), [here](https://github.com/RomanKoshkin/R) and [here](https://github.com/RomanKoshkin/NLP-Python).
