## Description

This repo contains the macros we used as part of our [EEG/ERP study](https://doi.org/10.1101/212951) to prepare time-coded transcripts of source audio and their translated versions for further use in conjunction with EEG data and analysis in MATLAB and R. For other scripts and datasets, please refer to our other repositories [here](https://github.com/RomanKoshkin/EEG), [here](https://github.com/RomanKoshkin/R) and [here](https://github.com/RomanKoshkin/NLP-Python).
